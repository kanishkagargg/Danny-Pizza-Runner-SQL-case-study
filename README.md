# Danny Pizza Runner SQL Challenge

I recently finished the Danny's Pizza Runner case study challenge, which was quite extensive, featuring six tables and numerous questions. While some questions were straightforward, others required me to brainstorm and explore various approaches to tackle different scenarios. I've compiled the most intriguing and challenging questions in the attached PDF. I would appreciate any advice or alternative solutions you might have to offer for these problems.

Six tables are as follows:
* runners
* runner orders
* pizza toppings
* pizza names
* pizza recipes
* customer orders
